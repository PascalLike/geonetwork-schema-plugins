# DCAT-AP Schema Plugin for GeoNetwork

The [schemas/dcat-ap](/schemas/dcat-ap) folder contains a [DCAT-AP v1.1](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/asset_release/dcat-ap-v11) schema plugin for [GeoNetwork](http://geonetwork-opensource.org/). 

The work on this schema plugin was funded by the [OpenTransportNet](http://opentransportnet.eu/) innovation project funding by the European Unionâ€™s Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme under grant agreement no. 620533. The work was carried out at the request of and in close collaboration with the Flemish Information Agency ([AIV](http://www.vlaanderen.be/nl/contact/adressengids/diensten-van-de-vlaamse-overheid/administratieve-diensten-van-de-vlaamse-overheid/beleidsdomein-kanselarij-en-bestuur/agentschap-informatie-vlaanderen)). 

## Features

* **XML Schema for DCAT-AP**: This plugin makes use of the fact that GeoNetwork is capable of storing metadata in any XML format. The plugin therefore defines its own XML Schema (see the [schema](/schemas/dcat-ap/src/main/plugin/dcat-ap/schema)) folder for DCAT-AP that is used for the internal representation of DCAT-AP fields. To limit the data conversion needed, the XML Schema was designed to fully resemble an XML/RDF syntax of DCAT-AP.
* **Import script**: To import RDF metadata into GeoNetwork, something needs to be done to accomodate the many different formats (JSON-LD, Turtle, RDF/XML, etc.) and structure (nestings, ordering, etc.) that RDF data can take. Therefore, an import [script](/schemas/dcat-ap/src/main/plugin/dcat-ap/import) was written to "normalize" the RDF metadata, such that it fits in the XML Schema for DCAT-AP that was defined for the plugin. This script does the following: it downloads RDF metadata from a remote catalogue (curl), converts that into XML using a SPARQL SELECT query, converts that into DCAT-AP XML (XSL conversion), and imports this into GeoNetwork using the GeoNetwork API (curl).
* **DCAT-AP input form**: A custom form was created following the guidance in the GeoNetwork [form customization guide](http://geonetwork-opensource.org/manuals/trunk/eng/users/customizing-application/editor-ui/creating-custom-editor.html). The form pays a lot of attention to the use of controlled vocabularies - which can be imported as SKOS [classification systems](http://geonetwork-opensource.org/manuals/3.0.5/eng/users/administrator-guide/managing-classification-systems/index.html) using standard GeoNetwork functionality.
* **Export in DCAT-AP RDF format**: The plugin exports DCAT-AP RDF metadata using the GeoNetwork API (/geonetwork/srv/api/0.1/records), which can in turn be harvested by e.g. [CKAN](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat)


## Usage note 

To include this schema plugin in a build, copy the dcat-ap schema folder in the 
schemas folder, add it to the schemas/pom.xml 
and add it to the copy-schemas execution in web/pom.xml.

Samples and templates can be imported via the 'Admin Console' > 'Metadata and Templates' > 'DCAT-AP' menu.

## Future work

This plugin would merit further improvements in the following areas:
* Integration of the import script in a GeoNetwork DCAT harvester.
* Forms: The layout of the DCAT-AP editor needs furhter improvement. A number of components still need to be implemented (spatial coverage) or made more generic.
